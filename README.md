Kia ora

ðŸ˜„ This repository is about a real website of [Para Projects Limited](https://www.para-projects.co.nz/home).

## Website Style

The company is newly started and needs a website to exhibit its projects and certifications and attract potential customers. This is a frontend website written by React. It is more like a portfolio website. They only need the website to have one practical function -- a Contact Us form. The website styles they require are consistent, elegant, comprehensive, and responsive, as some people may check their website through phones. About the website colour, they want to match their company icon, shown as follows:

The theme colours of this website are black, orange, and white.

The website is deployed by AWS Amplify, which is a powerful website hosting tool. The messages from the contact us form will be sent to the company email by AWS API Gateway, AWS Lambda and AWS SES.
